===== PM4PY 1.2.6 =====
This is a minor release, consisting of the following changes:

    - Pyarrow serialization integration (supporting in-memory and to .pkl file serialization)
    - bug fix in the 'escaping edges' based precision


===== PM4PY 1.2.7 =====
This is a minor release, consisting of the following changes:

    - Bug fix (programming error) in the alignments code
    - Changed recursion depth in token-based replay invisibles exploration
    - Removed copy.copy for parent nodes of childs in log generation from process tree
    - Fixed "should_close" for XOR node in PT generation
    - Fixed "execute_enabled" for parallel and OR node in PT generation
    - Bug fix process tree children setter
    - Consider only fittin traces in the Align-ETConformance count
    - Consider ALL the optimal alignments (as described in the paper) and not only the first one
    - Refactoring: moving of utilities and making the search function using Dijkstra (since we are looking for fit paths) instead of A*
    - LTL Checker updated:
        - Making existing filters more performant (A eventually B eventually C)
        - Introducing A eventually B eventually C eventually D
        - Introducing time boundaries for each arc of the eventualties
